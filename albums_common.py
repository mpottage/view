# Produces photo albums for a website, based on the directory hierachy of a
# specified directory.
# Security Assumptions: Attacker has direct or indirect access to script via http/https,
#   can edit files inside document_root (excluding the albums code and directory) via sftp.

# Script protects against accessing files outside of the document root by two
# methods.
# 1. Checks that the real path of all files accessed starts with the real path
#       of the document root, i.e. No symlinks to outside the root.
# 2. Rejects any queries (query_path) paths that contain "../", "~" "/.".
#       This blocks navigation outside the albums. It also rejects hidden file
#       requests and paths starting with "/".

#Template files are normal HTML, with the exception of one line which
#contains only "${content}" to indicate that the HTML generated should be placed
#there. It is expected that the template includes the relevant CSS.
#    All styling is done via CSS. To alter the HTML generated change the format
#    strings found in the album's code.
